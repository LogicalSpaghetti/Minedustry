For each block:
up to 4 item inputs
up to 2 liquid inputs
up to 4 item outputs
up to 2 liquid outputs
up to 9x9 in size
power
heat
turret
possible output direction for each thing
max stack size is 1000 except in cores which go even higher
Vaults can hold an arbitrary number of stacks, but only a set number of items

to do:
Make a block entity of size n by n
Link their inventories and data
    Figure out how to set slot limitations, and get arbitrarily large sizes
Create liquids using standards for inventoried, bucketed, and in-world forms
    Add all the interactions between them (have fun with this)
Liquids should work as inputs and outputs
Handle an arbitrary number of inputs
Handle an arbitrary number of outputs

GraphitePress:
Reset to 16x16x16
Make it generate the four corners (maybe like a bed/door)
