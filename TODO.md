## Short-term goals:
### Graphite Press:
- get graphite blocks working with chests
- make GP fail to output into something facing it
- get GP working with hoppers
- get GP working with droppers Etc.

### Stacking:
- custom handling for stacks exceeding 64

### Belts:
- belts curve items
- belts limit each slot to a single item for in, out, and internal transfers

### Texturing:
- create textures
- have a separate texture for active blocks which cycles through an animation
- Everything references the same file, so it can be split without worrying
- silverfish-style textures, using a single rectangle with empty space
