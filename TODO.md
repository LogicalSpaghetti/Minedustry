## Short-term goals:
### Graphite Press:
- get graphite blocks working with chests
- make GP fail to output into something facing it
- get GP working with hoppers
- get GP working with droppers Etc.
### Stacking:
- custom handling for stacks exceeding 64
### Belts:
- belts curve items
- belts limit each slot to a single item for in, out, and internal transfers
- curving is just having it do the first calculation and a half but with x and z swapped
### Texturing:
- create textures
- have a separate texture for active blocks which cycles through an animation
- Everything references the same file, so it can be split without worrying
- silverfish-style textures, using a single rectangle with empty space
- start with very basic textures directly copying the originals
- create my own mostly original textures
- revamp the old textures to not have weirdness and to fit better in 3D
    - while preserving their style
- only include mine in the pack if they're better than the originals
## Long term goals:
- orthographic camera
- redo all models
